Note-Taker is an application that allows users to keep track of tasks to be completed. Note-Taker utilizes db.json as it's database. It's simplicity makes it a valuable tool for keeping tasks manageable. It was built using JavaScript and was an interesting project to build. I learned how to build a simple database and api routes.
